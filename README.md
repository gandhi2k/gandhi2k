- 👋 Hi, I’m @gandhi2k, Germany based digital nomad and spatial data analyst / geoinformatician / GIS technician

- 👀 I’m interested in OpenSource, Spatial Data and GIS, as well as social and climate justice and related projects.
- I am also involved in different projects in the event, arts and entertainment field (light installations, interactive and connecting games).
- In my spare-time I additionally like to work on my long-term project: a long-distance rallye-like traveling motorcycle conersion on base of a Honda Transalp PD06 and a Honda Africa Twin RD07.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP and try to keep my python, javascript, html+css skills up to date. For various projects I use the Arduino platform (C and C++)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of OpenSource  and non-commercial projects.
